README for randomization Folder
6 May 2020

This folder stores randomization scripts. Each script has 
a corresponding definition file that describes how it is 
executed.

Install all the required packages first using 
installPackages.R. It requires sudo and the global 
environment variable "EBSAF_ROOT" set to where ebs-af is 
located.

To set the global environment variable EBSAF_ROOT, add the
following line to /etc/environment (replace with your own 
settings):

EBSAF_ROOT=/home/admin/ebs-af

*You might need to restart your computer.

Check if EBSAF_ROOT is set by typing the following:

$ echo $EBSAF_ROOT

It should display the path you set.

Run installPackages.R:

$ sudo ./installPackages.R
