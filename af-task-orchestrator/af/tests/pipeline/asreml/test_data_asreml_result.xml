  Notice: XML output structures Variable and VPredict have been updated.

 Notice: In expanding at(loc), loc is assumed to have 2 levels. If
         more, specify the number in the variable definition for loc
 idv(row) in sat(loc,1).idv(row).ar1(col) has size 10, parameters:   9   9
 ar1(col) in sat(loc,1).idv(row).ar1(col) has size 18, parameters:  10  10
  sat(loc,1).idv(row).ar1(col)     [  8: 10] initialized.
 idv(row) in sat(loc,2).idv(row).ar1(col) has size 10, parameters:  12  12

  sat(loc,2).idv(row).ar1(col)     [ 11: 13] initialized.

 Note: col is defined as a labelled factor (probably with !I or !A).
       It may not sort the data correctly as labels are not sorted. Define it as
       a  *  factor to use the variable values directly as plot position coordinates.

 Note: row is defined as a labelled factor (probably with !I or !A).
       It may not sort the data correctly as labels are not sorted. Define it as
       a  *  factor to use the variable values directly as plot position coordinates.
 Sorting Section  1:     10 rows by  18 columns

 * This job uses all of the 8 processor threads. *
 * Notice: The code for generating a PREDICT .. !PRESENT .. design matrix   *
 *         was altered in July 2019 to make it faster in very SPARSE cases. *
 *         The labels may not match the values in complex situations.       *
 *         Be wary and report suspicious results to VSN.                    *
 Notice: 2 singularities detected in design matrix.

 Notice: 2 singularities appeared in Average Information matrix
          This could be a problem of scale or a problem with the model.
          It is preferable to revise the model to remove the singularity.
          Specify !AISING qualifier to force the job to continue.
 Notice: Predicted values are not formed because iteration is aborted.

 S means there is no information in the data for this parameter.
 Very small components with Comp/SE ratios of zero sometimes indicate poor
           scaling.  Consider rescaling the design matrix in such cases.
